Java Programs Repository

Welcome to my Java repository! This collection includes a variety of **basic Java programs** and comprehensive **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations, designed to help with learning and mastering core programming concepts.

---

The repository is organized into the following folders:

🟢 Basic
Contains beginner-level Java programs that cover:
- Input/Output operations
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and Strings
- Functions and Recursion
- File Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics

🔵 DSA
Includes implementations of standard Data Structures and Algorithms:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's)
- Sorting Algorithms(Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Searching Algorithms(Linear, Binary)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming(Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
